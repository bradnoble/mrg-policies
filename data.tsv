1	policy	Uphill & after hours policy	UPHILL TRAFFIC IS NOT PERMITTED DURING HOURS OF LIFT OPERATIONS We ask that you leave the base area no later than 45 minutes before the lifts actually open so that you can get up top before encountering skiers coming downhill.	https://www.madriverglen.com/uphill-and-after-hours-policy/		
2	policy	Snowboard policy	In an effort to preserve the mountain’s unique character the shareholders of the Mad River Glen Cooperative have opted to not permit snowboarding at Mad River Glen. We are well aware that this policy is quite uncommon and we strive to make sure that people are aware of the policy prior to visiting.	https://www.madriverglen.com/snowboard-policy/		
3	policy	Drone policy	Out of safety concerns for guests, employees and ski area property, as well as concerns for individual privacy, Mad River Glen Ski Area prohibits the operation or use of unmanned aerial systems or drones by the general public – including recreational users and hobbyists – without the prior authorization from management.	https://www.madriverglen.com/drone-policy/		
4	policy	Operating hours	Generally speaking Mad River Glen’s season runs from mid-December to Mid -April. That being said, we are predominantly a natural snow mountain and we have to work with what Mother Nature provides.	http://www.madriverglen.com/hours/		
5	policy	Backpack policy	Small children and infants are not allowed in either front-loading carriers or backpack style carriers on any lift at Mad River Glen Ski Area.  It is RECOMMENDED that riders move the small backpack to the front of their torso to allow their back to touch the back of chair, and ensure all straps are tucked in and not dangling loose.  It is the guest’s responsibility to check for loose equipment before exiting the chairlift.
