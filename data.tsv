6	decision	Charging seniors	Shareholder Craig Keown presented a letter to the board expressing dismay at the decision to start charging senior (over 70) shareholders for lift services. He gave a passionate speech about his family’s long time support of Mad River Glen and his concern that MRG was changing. He suggested charging all shareholders a small amount or raising the APR instead of charging seniors. He contended this was a fundamental change in the MRG bylaws and called for a vote by the shareholders to approve that change. The board responded that considerable thought and discussion went into the decision to make the change and the fact it had been suggested by other senior shareholders. The board discussed his contention and unanimously agreed it was not a fundamental change requiring a vote by shareholders.	https://www.madriverglen.com/meeting-item/board-of-trustees-minutes-sept-13-2014/	September 13, 2014

31	decision	Letters sent to Trustees from Shareholders	Deri Meier asked the Board about procedures to acknowledge letters sent to the trustees. Question was asked about whether those letters should be included in the minutes. The Trustees determined that the letter in question should not be included in minutes because it is an employment reference. In general, the board will acknowledge receipt of letters from shareholders and members of the MRG community. Unless specifically requested at a board meeting, the Trustees will not consider whether to have a letter become a part of the official minutes.	https://www.madriverglen.com/meeting-item/board-of-trustees-meeting-minutes-november-12-2016/	November 12, 2016

Jon Anderson (in-state) is term-limited. John Tobin (out-of-state) and Alan Bates (in-state) plan to run again. John Stetson pointed out that since Alan would be up for re-election in 2017 that it would be a conflict for him to manage that committee. All agreed and Alan resigned after his successful and momentary tenure.	https://www.madriverglen.com/meeting-item/board-of-trustees-meeting-minutes-november-12-2016/	November 12, 2016

34	precedent	Trustee Compensation	1. Deri Meier – asked about the interim manager’s contract and whether that sets a precedent. 2. John Stetson – stated that the interim general contract was needed and that the Board and Interim General Manager had been doing a great job seeing the Coop through a difficult time. 3. Bill Coyle– Trustees should not be compensated and expressed concern that this creates conflicts of interest and violates bylaws. 4. Ron Shems – stated that the contract is explicitly for management services and not for any trustee duties. It is common for organizations such as the Coop to appoint a board member as interim GM. To expect someone to volunteer 20 to 50 hours a week for more than 5 months, in addition to Board duties, is unrealistic. The Board’s obligation to assure the Coop’s sound management requires professional management.	https://www.madriverglen.com/meeting-item/board-of-trustees-meeting-minutes-january-14-2017/	January 14, 2017

36	motion (approved)	Monthly meeting schedule	1. Presently, the Board meets on the 2nd Sat. of each month and the Finance Committee meets the Thursday before. This leaves little time for staff to prepare financials. Also, many payables come later in the month afterward after the meetings, so the information is incomplete and not as accurate as could be. John T suggests that we move FC meeting one week later, which means that the Board meeting should also be moved. We would be one month behind, but FC meetings would see more timely numbers. 2. Specifically, the proposal is to move meetings to:FC: 3rd Thursday of month, (Thurs prior to Board mtg)Board: 3rd Saturday of the month, New schedule to start in May, after the April Annual meeting.	https://www.madriverglen.com/meeting-item/board-of-trustees-meeting-minutes-february-11-2017/	February 11, 2017

49	clip	Directors and Officers (D&O) Insurance	Matt is looking at Coop expenses across the board and is in the process of reviewing and updating Directors & Officer’s insurance (D&O). Several years ago the Board approved a more expensive policy due to concerns about risk to the mountain and to the Directors. Matt questions whether this level of coverage is still necessary, since MRG’s premium is higher than normal. Matt reviewed other ways the mountain is protected including employee training, VSAA coverage, various state inspections, and MRG’s exemplary safety record. The Board felt it needs more time and information, and would like to see completion of Employee Handbook of policies, before revising the policy. Thus for the time being MRG should continue with current D&O policy.	https://www.madriverglen.com/meeting-item/board-of-trustees-meeting-minutes-december-15-2018/	December 15, 2018	22

52	motion (approved)	Capital Expense Improvement Plan	1. Matt L. presented his proposed Capital Improvement Plan for FY 2019 in the amount of $264,527 (see attached). The plan included 8 line items below $50,000 related to snowmaking; Birdcage improvements; roads, trails, and culverts; and Lift 4 painting as well as a Snowmaking proposal that exceeded $50,000. Matt L. expects that grants from the Campaign will fund all projects. 2. The latter proposal related to the extension of snowmaking to the 2,300 foot elevation under the Double Chair, up to Tower 6 of the Single on Bunny, Rockefellers, up to the top of the Practice Slope and to the top of Eaton’s Run, and from Tower 2 of the double the bottom of Eaton’s run. This $76,250 proposal was for material only with installation done by staff. The additional snowmaking coverage restores the system to its historical level and effectively completes the snowmaking capital plan, with the exception of normal replacement of items. It is not anticipated that the additional snowmaking coverage will increase operating expenses as the additional electrical usage will be more than offset by lower rates and the crew will not have to relocate equipment or snow as frequently as in the past.     1.

53	decision	Trustee Appointments	Ron met with Deri Meier about his proposed amendment to the bylaws that would require that a Trustee who is appointed to fill a vacancy run in the next election, rather than serve the remaining term of the vacant seat. There was discussion of “better democracy” versus a deterrent to fill vacant seats. The Trustees found no compelling reason to recommend the amendment at this time but agreed to consider it again in the future along with other potential amendments.	https://www.madriverglen.com/meeting-item/board-of-trustees-meeting-minutes-february-16-2019/	February 16, 2019

Watershed Protection was postponed from 2021 to 2022. 3. Callies Corner     1.
